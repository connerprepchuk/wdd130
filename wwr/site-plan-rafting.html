    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to create a website where everyone and anyone can come and enjoy White Water Rafting. THis website will benifit our company because
    it allows more people easier access to White Water Rafting and to be able to quickly find a summary of what it is and how to do it, creating a wider audience.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is generally going to be outdoorsy and athletic people, and may know their way around a website, but not if we make it too complex. It is important 
    to keep this in mind when we create our website so that we can keep those types of people engaged with an easy to manage and maneuver website. Color, font, 
    location, etc. are all factors in this engaging and easy website to use.

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
